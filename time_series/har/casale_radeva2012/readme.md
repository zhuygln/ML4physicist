## Details



### Ultimately this is a time-series classification project where you are trying to classify the following classes (codified by numbers): 



--- 1: Working at Computer 

--- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going Up/Down stairs 

--- 3: Standing 

--- 4: Walking 

--- 5: Going Up/Down Stairs 

--- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone 

--- 7: Talking while Standing



Though a full analysis is not required, a discussion of how the window-ing of the data will affect the analysis is expected. The ideal classification model will be able to use minimal quantities/time windows of the data to predict each class (i.e. not the entire time-series per user per class). 





### Data Set Information:

--- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest 

--- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz 

--- Accelerometer data are uncalibrated

--- Number of participants: 15 

--- Number of activities: 7 

--- Data format: CSV



### Attribute Information:

--- Data are separated by participant 

--- Each file contains the following information: 

   --- sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label 

--- Labels are codified by numbers
