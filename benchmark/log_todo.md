### Summary
- setup environment for several open source auto ML tools on window sublinux and linux server(redhat). For now, our list of tools are auto-sklearn, tpot, h2o.ai. I some did some research on how the automated ML benchmarking was done in this field. We may be able to introduce more tools without much extra work.

- Suggested examples from the tutorials are under testing. I chose classification problems with more focus on banking and rare event classification.
